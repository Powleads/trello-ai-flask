# Icon Files

Place the following icon files in this directory:

- `icon.png` - Main application icon (512x512px recommended)
- `icon.ico` - Windows icon file
- `icon.icns` - macOS icon file  
- `tray.png` - System tray icon (16x16px or 24x24px)

You can generate these icons from a single high-resolution PNG using online tools or icon generators.

## Temporary Solution:
For now, the app will work without icons, but you should add them for a professional appearance.
