# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Since automatic repository creation failed due to authentication, follow these steps to manually create and push your repository:

## 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `justgoingviral-mcp`
   - **Description**: `A unified MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that consolidates multiple MCP servers into a single interface`
   - **Public/Private**: Choose Public (recommended for open source)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

3. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Push Your Local Repository

After creating the repository on GitHub, you'll see instructions. Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/dbsal/Documents/GitHub/JustGoingViral

# Add your GitHub repository as the remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/justgoingviral-mcp.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## 3. Verify Upload

After pushing, refresh your GitHub repository page. You should see:
- All your source files
- The README.md with proper formatting
- The LICENSE file
- The .gitignore file

## 4. Optional: Add Topics

On your GitHub repository page:
1. Click the gear icon next to "About"
2. Add topics like: `mcp`, `model-context-protocol`, `cline`, `ai-tools`, `typescript`
3. This helps others discover your project

## 5. Optional: Enable GitHub Pages (for documentation)

If you want to host documentation:
1. Go to Settings â†’ Pages
2. Select "Deploy from a branch"
3. Choose "main" branch and "/docs" folder (if you add documentation later)

## Repository URL

Once created, your repository will be available at:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/justgoingviral-mcp
```

## Sharing

To share your MCP server with others, they can:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/justgoingviral-mcp.git
cd justgoingviral-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

Then configure it in their Cline settings as described in the README.
