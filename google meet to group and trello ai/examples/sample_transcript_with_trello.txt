John Smith: Good morning everyone, thanks for joining our sprint review meeting. Let's start with updates from each team member.

Sarah Johnson: Hi John, I wanted to give an update on the user authentication system that we've been working on. The card "Implement OAuth2 login" is progressing well. We've completed the backend integration and are now working on the frontend components.

Mike Chen: That's great Sarah. I've been working on the API documentation task. The progress on "Create REST API documentation" has been slower than expected due to some complexity in our endpoint structures, but I should have it done by Thursday.

John Smith: Thanks Mike. What about the database optimization work?

Sarah Johnson: Oh yes, regarding the "Database performance optimization" card, we discovered that the main bottleneck is in our user query patterns. I've implemented some index optimizations that should improve performance by about 40%.

Mike Chen: That's excellent. I also wanted to mention that the "Frontend component library" task is ready for review. I've added all the basic components we discussed and they're now available in our design system.

John Smith: Perfect. Let's talk about the upcoming sprint. Sarah, can you update the "Sprint planning preparation" card with today's discussion points?

Sarah Johnson: Absolutely. I'll add notes about the auth system progress and the database optimizations we discussed.

Mike Chen: I also have an update on the "Bug fix for payment gateway" issue. We identified the root cause and I've submitted a fix. The card should be moved to testing soon.

John Smith: Great work everyone. One more thing - the "User onboarding flow" needs some updates based on the new authentication system. Sarah, since you're handling the auth work, could you review that card and add your insights?

Sarah Johnson: Sure thing. I'll take a look at the onboarding flow and update the card with recommendations.

Mike Chen: Before we wrap up, the "Mobile app deployment" card has been blocked by some App Store review issues, but we're working through them with Apple's feedback.

John Smith: Thanks for the update Mike. Let's make sure all these discussion points are captured in the relevant Trello cards. This way we have a good record of our decisions and progress updates.

Sarah Johnson: I'll make sure to update all the cards we mentioned with today's discussion points.

John Smith: Perfect. Thanks everyone for a productive meeting. Let's catch up again next week with our progress.
