It should be like download or something. I can't remember what it is. Um, but yeah, if you ask Chat GPT, it should definitely um give you convert that sharing link into a download link and then you can put those in and um yeah, just test that. Does that make sense?",

Um and yeah so oh no um you need to put it in a separate folder and anyone with this link can edit and then take that share link give it to AI and say turn this into a download link um a you know a Google Drive download link and then as soon as they click on that it's going to auto download instead of taking them to Google and then getting sign in and then doing all that jazz.",
